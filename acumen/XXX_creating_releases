Every time someone pushes to master the build server creates a
snapshot or test release.  You can download the latest release by
going to:

  https://194.47.22.8:8081/job/acumen-dev_-_master_-_release/

and downloading the zip under "Last Successful Artifacts".

Snapshot releases contain 8 digit hex code that correspond to the
corresponding Git commit.

Public releases are generally kept at
https://bitbucket.org/effective/acumen-dev/downloads.  If you are
logged in and have the correct privileges you should see a link to
upload new files and delete existing ones.

Before sending this to testers the instructions in
XXX_for_external_tester.mdown should be followed to sanity check the
release and make sure they instructions are still accurate.
