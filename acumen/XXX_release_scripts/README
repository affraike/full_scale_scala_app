BASIC USAGE:

To create a snapshot release:

  cd XXX_release_scripts/
  ./mk-release.sh

This will create a zip file

  YYYY_MM_DD_COMMITID_Acumen.zip

The script uses two environmental variables if they are set:
  SBT: command to run sbt
  GIT_COMMIT: commit id to create the release from

CREATING A FULL RELEASE:

To create a full release the same script can be used but some
additional manual steps are required.

First create the zip file using:

  ./mk-release.sh YY MM DD

(substitute YY MM DD with the appropriate values)

After that follow the instructions in release_instructions to
upload the zip file and tag the upstream repository.

CLEANUP:

The script mk-release-clean.sh will remove any old releases still in
the current directory and GIT_COMMIT is provided by the Jenkins build
server.

FOR MAC USERS:

If you get a syntax error when executing mk-release.sh, then your 
system has an incompatible version of "date" installed. To work 
around this, install GNU core utilities using Homebrew:

  brew install coreutils

Then, use the following command to create the ZIP file:

  PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH" ./mk-release.sh YY MM DD

(substitute YY MM DD with the appropriate values)
