Walid: This sequence of examples is interesting and OK for the most
part, but it is not as focused as the basic differential equations
sequence or the robust simulation examples.  We should work on
tightening up this sequence.  The examples don't need to change, but
we should make more use of these examples to illustrate more features
of process of computing enclosures.  As we have more support for
running simulations with both enclosure-based and traditional solvers,
we'll probably have more things to talk about with this very same
(basic) sequence.
