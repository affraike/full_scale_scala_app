\subsection{version 10.09.30 (September 30th 2010)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item user can now select the number of threads for the parallel interpreter
    \item it is now possible to create objects inside Main's private section; fixes  issue 25 
    \item \lstinline{~=} is now interpreted; fixes  issue 23 
    \item it is now possible to move one's direct child to one of its children; fixes  issue 22 
    \item semicolons are now accepted at the end of an instruction block, but are optional; addresses  issue 20 
    \item variable and class identifiers are now free to start with either a lowercase or an upprcase letter; they may also contain underscores; addresses  issue 19 
    \item Exception generation was not localized in Acumen's internal source code. This made it harder to keep manuals and tutorials consistent, and to check user-level error reports for consistency and style. This has been fixed by localizing in one place where the text for user-level error reports is generated; addresses  issue 17

    \item the convention is now that Main's first argument is called simulator; addresses  issue 11 
    \item gensym is now local (as opposed to accessing a global counter): objects ids are now hierarchical (e.g. \lstinline{#1.0.2})
    \item the application logic of the UI is now clean and separate from the interaction/drawing code
    \item switch from SwingWorker to actor based concurrency for the UI
    \item turned names into atoms (huge speedup)
    \item conformance tests of reference and parallel interpreters are run on every example (ant test)
    \item added a benchmark command-line option for parallel interpreter (bench)
    \item added a parallel interpreter (command-line only for now)
    \item got rid of explicit "init" in the UI
    \item merged play and pause buttons
\end{itemize}
