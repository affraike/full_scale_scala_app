Release Workflow (2013/05/10)
-----------------------------

There are two repositories:

  - acumen-dev   This is where active development happens
    		      - master      This is the main development branch

  - acumen       This has two branches:
    		      - master      Snapshots of acumen-dev/master
		      - release     Sensored (released) snapshot of prerelease

Most people working on development work on "master".

In preparing for a release, changes in "acumen-dev/master" are tagged
and coppied to "acumen/master".

The actual release involves removing (censoring) files marked with
XXX, and the remainder is sent to "release".
